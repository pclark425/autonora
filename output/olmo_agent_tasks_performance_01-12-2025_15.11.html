<h3>Abstract</h3>
<i>
The goal of this research was to evaluate the performance of the language model OLMo on agent-based tasks similar to those found in AlfWorld, which require navigating environments and manipulating objects. Our approach involved generating a dataset of 30 diverse tasks, running OLMo to obtain step-by-step solutions for each task, and scoring these solutions using GPT-as-judge based on criteria such as correctness of actions, understanding of the environment, and successful completion of the task. Categories were then ideated to characterize tasks where OLMo performed well or poorly, and these categories were scored to identify patterns in performance. The findings indicate that OLMo excels in routine technology use but struggles with environmental assessment and spatial navigation. This work is significant as it provides insights into the capabilities and limitations of language models in performing complex agent-based tasks, informing future developments in AI-driven interactive systems.

<h2>Introduction</h2>
The burgeoning field of artificial intelligence has seen significant advancements in language models, with applications extending beyond traditional natural language processing tasks. The motivation for this research lies in exploring the adaptability of such models to agent-based tasks, which are integral to interactive systems like AlfWorld. These tasks often require a nuanced understanding of environmental contexts and the ability to perform sequences of actions akin to human behavior.

In this study, we sought to characterize the performance of OLMo, a language model, on a curated set of agent-based tasks. Our methodology involved generating a dataset that mirrors the complexity and diversity of real-world scenarios where navigation and object manipulation are key. OLMo was tasked with providing step-by-step solutions for each scenario, which were then rigorously scored based on their accuracy and adherence to task requirements.

The main findings reveal that OLMo demonstrates proficiency in tasks involving routine technology use, suggesting an aptitude for structured procedural activities. Conversely, it exhibits challenges with tasks requiring environmental assessment and spatial navigation - areas that demand a deeper contextual understanding and dynamic decision-making. These results underscore the potential and current limitations of language models in agent-based applications, offering valuable insights for future AI research and development.

  <h2>Approach</h2>
The approach to evaluating OLMo's performance on agent-based tasks involved a multi-step process designed to simulate the complexity of real-world scenarios. The methodology was as follows:

<ol>
<li><strong>Dataset Generation:</strong> We created a dataset of 30 unique agent-based tasks, each requiring navigation and object manipulation within various environments. These tasks were inspired by AlfWorld, ensuring a range of difficulties and contexts.</li>
<li><strong>Task Execution:</strong> OLMo was run on the dataset, tasked with generating step-by-step solutions for each scenario. The model's responses were collected for analysis.</li>
<li><strong>Solution Scoring:</strong> A GPT-as-judge system scored OLMo's solutions on a scale from 0 (completely wrong) to 1 (completely correct). The scoring criteria included correctness of actions, understanding of the environment, and successful task completion.</li>
<li><strong>Category Ideation:</strong> Based on the scores, we ideated categories that could characterize the tasks where OLMo performed well or poorly. This helped in identifying patterns in the model's performance across different types of tasks.</li>
<li><strong>Category Scoring:</strong> Each category was then scored using the average performance of OLMo on tasks within that category. This provided a metric to quantify which categories were most indicative of high or low performance.</li>
</ol>

This comprehensive approach allowed us to systematically assess OLMo's capabilities and identify specific areas where improvements are needed for better performance in agent-based task execution.

<h2>Results</h2>
The experimental results yielded a spectrum of performances by OLMo across the 30 agent-based tasks. The key findings are as follows:

<ol>
<li>The overall average score for OLMo's task performance was approximately 0.77, indicating a generally good level of understanding and execution.</li>
<li>OLMo excelled in tasks involving routine technology use, achieving perfect scores in scenarios such as turning on a computer and opening software applications.</li>
<li>Tasks that required environmental assessment, such as identifying water leaks or mold growths, posed challenges for OLMo, with an average category score of 0.7.</li>
<li>OLMo showed difficulty with spatial navigation tasks, particularly those requiring careful movement within a space without disturbing other objects, scoring an average of 0.73 in this category.</li>
<li>The model performed well in information processing tasks that involved organizing objects or information systematically, such as sorting papers into folders or beads by color, with an average score of 0.82.</li>
</ol>

These results highlight areas where OLMo demonstrates strong capabilities and others where further development is needed to enhance performance on complex agent-based tasks.

<h2>Analysis</h2>
The analysis of OLMo's performance on agent-based tasks reveals a nuanced understanding of procedural and systematic activities, while highlighting limitations in contextual interpretation and physical interaction. For instance, OLMo's perfect score in routine technology use is exemplified by its ability to articulate the steps for turning on a computer and opening a word processing program, showcasing proficiency in tasks with clear procedures and expected outcomes.

Conversely, OLMo struggled with environmental assessment tasks such as checking for water leaks or mold growths. This suggests that the model may lack the ability to infer less structured tasks that require an interpretation of sensory data or abstract concepts. Similarly, spatial navigation posed challenges; in one task where OLMo had to water plants without stepping on them, it provided logical steps but lacked the nuanced understanding necessary for careful physical movement within a space.

In information processing tasks like sorting papers into folders by category, OLMo performed well. This aligns with its strengths in organizing data systematically - a skill that is closely related to language models' core capabilities in pattern recognition and categorization.

These findings indicate that while OLMo can handle structured tasks effectively, it may require additional training or more advanced algorithms capable of simulating human-like perception and decision-making for complex agent-based interactions.

<h2>Conclusion</h2>
The research conducted on OLMo's performance in agent-based tasks similar to those in AlfWorld has led to several key conclusions:

<ol>
<li>OLMo is proficient in executing structured tasks with clear procedures, particularly those related to routine technology use, where it achieved the highest scores.</li>
<li>The model faces challenges with tasks that require environmental assessment and spatial navigation, indicating a need for improved contextual understanding and physical interaction capabilities.</li>
<li>OLMo's ability to systematically organize information suggests that its underlying strengths lie in pattern recognition and categorization, which are core aspects of language models.</li>
</ol>

These findings underscore the potential of language models like OLMo in specific domains while also highlighting areas where further development is necessary. The insights gained from this study can inform future advancements in AI-driven interactive systems, aiming to bridge the gap between current capabilities and human-like task execution.
