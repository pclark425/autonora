Okay! We are ready to get started on a new research task!

Your top-level research task is: Characterize how well the language model OLMo can perform 2-digit addition.

YOUR NEXT INSTRUCTION: generate a plan to perform this research. Return your plan as a JSON object with the following structure:

As a reminder, your top-level research task is: Characterize how well the language model OLMo can perform 2-digit addition.

Here is the current plan we are following:

6. Write a report summarizing the findings.


We will start with the first step, step 1: Generate a dataset of 30 addition questions that involve 2-digit numbers, e.g., 'What is 23 + 41?'

As a reminder, your top-level research task is: Characterize how well the language model OLMo can perform 2-digit addition.

Here is the current plan we are following:
1. Generate a dataset of 30 addition questions that involve 2-digit numbers, e.g., 'What is 23 + 41?'
2. Collect answers from OLMo for the generated dataset and add them to the DataFrame.
3. Score the answers using GPT-as-judge on a scale from 0 to 1 and collect justifications for each score.
4. Ideate categories of question where OLMo does unusually badly and unusually well.
5. Score those categories to find the top 3 where OLMo performs worst and best.
6. Write a report summarizing the findings.


We are currently on step 1: Generate a dataset of 30 addition questions that involve 2-digit numbers, e.g., 'What is 23 + 41?'

According to your last reflection, there was a problem implementing/executing this step.

YOUR NEXT INSTRUCTION: Try again, and generate new Python code that implements this step. Pay particular
attention to avoid the problem that occurred last time. I'll then execute it and show you the results.

As a reminder, your top-level research task is: Characterize how well the language model OLMo can perform 2-digit addition.

Here is the current plan we are following:
1. Generate a dataset of 30 addition questions that involve 2-digit numbers, e.g., 'What is 23 + 41?'
2. Collect answers from OLMo for the generated dataset and add them to the DataFrame.
3. Score the answers using GPT-as-judge on a scale from 0 to 1 and collect justifications for each score.
4. Ideate categories of question where OLMo does unusually badly and unusually well.
5. Score those categories to find the top 3 where OLMo performs worst and best.
6. Write a report summarizing the findings.


We have successfully completed step number 3.
We will now move to step 4: Ideate categories of question where OLMo does unusually badly and unusually well.

23. Reflect on Step 5
----------------------------------------

As a reminder, your top-level research task is: Characterize how well the language model OLMo can perform 2-digit addition.

Here is the current plan we are following:
1. Generate a dataset of 30 addition questions that involve 2-digit numbers, e.g., 'What is 23 + 41?'
2. Collect answers from OLMo for the generated dataset and add them to the DataFrame.
3. Score the answers using GPT-as-judge on a scale from 0 to 1 and collect justifications for each score.
4. Ideate categories of question where OLMo does unusually badly and unusually well.
5. Score those categories to find the top 3 where OLMo performs worst and best.
6. Write a report summarizing the findings.


We are currently on step 5: Score those categories to find the top 3 where OLMo performs worst and best.

YOUR NEXT INSTRUCTION: Perform a REFLECTION step to assess if top-level task is complete, the current plan step is complete, and what to do next.

Assess:
 - thought: Summarize the progress made so far in the research, and what to do next
 - task_complete: Have you achieved the top-level research task?
 - current_step_complete: Have you successfully completed the current step in the plan?
 - next_step_type:
     - If task_complete is true, then 'exit' 
     - If current_step_complete is true, then 'next_step'
     - If the current step was only partially completed, then 'continue'
     - If there was a Python error, and it seems fixable, then 'debug'
     - If you seem to be stuck, looping, or going around in circles, then 'retry'
     
Return the results as a JSON structure of the form:
   {"thought": STRING, "task_complete": BOOLEAN, "current_step_complete": BOLEAN, "next_step_type": one of 'exit', 'next_step', 'continue', 'debug', or 'retry'}

According to your last reflection, there was a problem implementing/executing this step.
